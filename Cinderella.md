# Cinderella's Shoe Challenge Solution

## Problem Statement
Cinderella has N pairs of shoes, but the Fairy Godmother has magically shuffled them all. Each shoe is unique and only pairs with its twin. Cinderella needs to leave by midnight and must find all the matching pairs quickly. Design an algorithm that helps Cinderella find all the matching pairs of shoes. Assume each shoe can be represented as an integer, and a pair is two of the same integer. Optimize for time complexity to help her leave before midnight.
